This year has an AoC as well. https://adventofcode.com/2020

I'll work in python 3.9 this time.

# Day 1
A nice little "work with a list" type of thing.
I went for a haskell'y generator based approach.
This way I don't need to think about how long the list is and whether the list of all products fit in memory etc.
It is day1 however so I guess there would be no problem.

To solve part B, I rewrote the code a little so it could handle both cases.
